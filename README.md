# Pact::Message

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/pact-foundation/pact-message-ruby](https://badges.gitter.im/pact-foundation/pact-message-ruby.svg)](https://gitter.im/pact-foundation/pact-message-ruby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Create and verify consumer driven contracts for messages.



## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'pact'
gem 'pact-message'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install pact
    $ gem install pact-message

## Usage

The key to using Message Pact is to completely separate the business logic that creates the message from the transmission protocol (eg. Kafka, Websockets, Lambda). This allows you to write a contract for the message contents, no matter how it is communicated.

See the general [Message Pact docs](https://docs.pact.io/getting_started/how_pact_works#non-http-testing-message-pact) for more information.

### Consumer

Not finished yet as nobody has asked for it. Ping @Beth Skurrie on slack.pact.io if you'd like use this.
Update: Done but not documented yet. See https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-message-ruby/blob/master/spec/features/create_message_pact_spec.rb#L78 for an example.

### Provider

Also called a "producer". Message pact verification follows all the same principles as HTTP pact verification, except that instead of verifying that a provider can make the expected HTTP response, we are verifying that the provider can create the expected message. Please read the HTTP Pact [verification](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby/wiki/Verifying-pacts) documentation. The only difference is in the configuration block. Use `message_provider` instead of `service_provider`, and configure a `builder` block that takes a `|description|` argument, instead of a Rack `app` block.

Make sure you've required 'pact/message' as well as 'pact'.

```ruby
require 'pact'
require 'pact/message'

Pact.message_provider "MyMessageProvider" do  
  honours_pact_with "MyMessageConsumer" do
    pact_uri "/path/or/url/to/your/pact", { 
                          username: "optional username", 
                          password: "optional password", 
                          token: "optional token"
                        }
  end
  
  # or
  
  honours_pacts_from_pact_broker do
    # See docs at https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby/wiki/Verifying-pacts
  end
  
  builder do |message_description|
    #... code that accepts a message description and returns 
    # a message hash that should match what is expected in the pact
  end
end

```

How you map between the message description and the code that creates the message is up to you. The easiest way is something like this:

```ruby
class MyMessageProvider
  def create_hello_message
    {
      text: "Hello world"
    }
  end
end

CONFIG = {
  "a hello message" => lambda { MyMessageProvider.new.create_hello_message }
}

Pact.message_provider "SomeProvider" do
  builder do |description|
    CONFIG[description].call
  end
end

```

#### Provider states

Provider states work the same way for Message Pact as they do for HTTP Pact. Please read the [provider state](https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-ruby#using-provider-states) docs in the HTTP Pact project.

## Development

### Setup

After checking out the repo, run the following to install dependencies.

```bash
$ bundle exec bin/setup

bundle install
\+ bundle install
...
Bundle complete! 6 Gemfile dependencies, 29 gems now installed.
Use `bundle info [gemname]` to see where a bundled gem is installed.

Do any other automated setup that you need to do here
```

### Tests

Run the following command to run the tests.

```bash
$ bundle exec rake spec

the CLI
  creates a pact file with the given message
  creates a pact file with a message from the standard input
...
Finished in 0.50883 seconds (files took 0.15053 seconds to load)
26 examples, 0 failures, 2 pending
```

### Interactive Prompt

You can run the following command for an for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

```bash
$ bundle exec bin/console
2.6.6 :001 >
```

To execute commands on the CLI run the following command followed by command line arguments as you would with the published version.

```bash
$ bundle exec bin/pact-message
Commands:
  pact-message help [COMMAND]                                                                   # Describe available commands or one specific command
  pact-message reify                                                                            # Take a JSON document with embedded pact matchers and return...
  pact-message update MESSAGE_JSON --consumer=CONSUMER --pact-dir=PACT_DIR --provider=PROVIDER  # Update/create a pact. If MESSAGE_JSON is omitted or '-', it...
  pact-message version                                                                          # Show the pact-message gem version
```

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
